The purpose of this project is to create a program exploring function of the OpenCV and PyAutoGUI libraries.
The program is made to automatically play the online game 'Among Us'. The game is owned by Innersloth Studios and
I have no relations with the company. 

The main task of this program is to:
-Match image portions to sections on the screen in +/- 500ms time
-Upon a match, perform a series of keyboard and mouse actions
