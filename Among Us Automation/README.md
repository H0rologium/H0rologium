The purpose of this project is to create a program exploring function of the OpenCV and PyAutoGUI libraries.
The program is made to automatically play the online game 'Among Us'. The game is owned by Innersloth Studios and
I have no relations with the company. 

The main task of this program is to:

-Match image portions to sections on the screen in +/- 500ms time

-Upon a match, perform a series of keyboard and mouse actions 

This program does occaisionally use values for a resolution of 1920 x 1200. While implementing dynamic resolutions would not be impossible, this project is only for self-education,
and as such I currently do not have plans on packaging officially. If you'd like to submit a PR I'm willing to review it, however.
