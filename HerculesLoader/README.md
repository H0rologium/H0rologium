# Hercules Loader

## A desktop loader for utilities

*What is this project?* : This is a rewrite of an older project of mine. I essentially had various scripts and programs floating around my pc that did various things. This program tries to centralize most of the (.NET) ones
The base program itself is just a system tray icon. Actual utilities are loaded in at runtime using reflection. I may eventually write a wiki for adding new modules.

Last tested on windows 10 using .NET 10. Compiles as a normal console application.
